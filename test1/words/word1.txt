Most of us are taught to pay attention to what issaid-the words.Words do provide us with some information,but meanings are derived from so many other sources that it would hinder our effectivenessas a partner to a relationship to rely too heavily onwords alone.Words are used to describe only asmall part of the many ideas we associate with any given message.Sometimes we can gain insight into some of those associations if we listen for more than words.We dont always say what we mean or mean what we say.Sometimes our words dont mean anything except Im letting off some steam.I dont really want you to pay close attention to what Im saying.Just pay attention to what Im feeling.Mostly we mean several things at once.A person wanting topurchase a house says to the current owner,This step has to be fixed before Ill buy.Theowner says,Its been like that for years.Actually,the step hasnt been like that for years,but the unspoken message is: I dont want to fix it.We put up with it.Why cant you?The search for a more expansive view of meaning can be developed of examining a message interms of who said it,when it occurred,the related conditions or situation,and how it was said.

　　When a message occurs can also reveal associated meaning.Let us assume two couples do exactly the same amount of kissing and arguing.But one couple always kisses after anargument and the other couple always argues after a kiss.The ordering of the behaviors maymean a great deal more than the frequency of the behavior.A friends unusually docile behaviormay only be understood by noting that it was preceded by situations that required an abnormalamount of assertiveness.Some responses may be directly linked to a developing pattern ofresponses and defy logic.For example,a person who says No! to a serials of charges likeYoure dumb,Youre lazy,and Youre dishonest,may also say No! and try to justify hisor her response if the next statement is And youre good looking.
　Dear,it is raining now,can you hear it

　　Dear,I am missing you now,can you feel it

　　Dear,do you remember those wonderful days we spent together,I just can’t bear smiling when thinking of you

　　Dear,do you remember we walked along the street that afternoon and now I can still feel the gentle wind

　　Dear,do you remember?do you understand ?

　　Dear,I can never request you to love me,even in hope of it

　　Dear,I know I can never compare with her,I don’t have beautiful appearance and a figure of gold

　　Dear,I just want you to know,what I want is very small and simple.I will be more than happy to see you and talk with you

　　Dear,I just want to be your friends as usual,and we can talk about current affairs easily and even comment President Bush’s policy freely

　　Dear,I still don’t know,why do you cheat me! She is my friend,my best friend,certainly I know I will give you my best wishes......

　　Dear,I still remember your words,your only words: I wish you to study hard and make more progress so that you can enter Beijing normal university and your dream will come true.There will be plenty of excellent boys in that university and each one will be much better than I,I just dont deserve you

　　Dear,I said nothing at that moment,but,but,only I know when I turned around,tears can’t help falling

　　Dear,I haven’t seen you for two years,and now maybe my dream has come true,and I already learnt to protect myself..but why are you keeping on cheating me?

　　I don’t want the world to see me,because I don’t think that they can understand

　　When everything is made to be broken,I just want you to know who I am
